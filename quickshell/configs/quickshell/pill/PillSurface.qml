/**
 * Shared morph-surface base for the pill's standard surfaces. Each surface fills
 * the pill body inset by its own margins (scaled by `s`), fades in with the morph
 * as it nears full openness, and is only enabled while open. The host sets `open`,
 * `s` and `morphCloseness`; the surface sets its own `mTop`/`mLeft`/`mRight`/
 * `mBottom` insets. `active` mirrors `open` for the older `onActiveChanged` hooks.
 * `requestClose()` asks the pill to dismiss. Osd and Toast use a different
 * lifecycle and do not derive from this base.
