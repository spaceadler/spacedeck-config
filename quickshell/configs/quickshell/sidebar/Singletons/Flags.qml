/**
 * Shared session flags persisted to a small JSON file and watched for external
 * change, so every Ricelin daemon (pill, sidebar) reads and writes the same
 * Do-Not-Disturb and Keep-Awake state live without a second notification server
 * or idle inhibitor. Toggling in one surface updates the others on the next file
 * event, and the state survives a daemon restart.
 *
 * The adapter mirrors the pill's full key set even though this surface only
 * drives dnd and keepAwake: JsonAdapter.writeAdapter() serialises only declared
 * properties and drops every other key, so a partial adapter writing this shared
 * file would wipe the pill's record and display prefs on each reload echo. The
 * extra fields exist purely to round-trip those keys; only dnd and keepAwake are
 * exposed as aliases since nothing here reads the rest.
